-   **Highly Customizable Passwords**:
    -   **Adjustable Length**: Choose a password length from 8 to 50 characters using an intuitive slider.
    -   **Character Sets**: Easily include or exclude uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and symbols (!@#$...).
-   **Memorable Passphrases**:
    -   Generate easy-to-remember passphrases using a predefined wordlist.
    -   Adjust the number of words from 3 to 20.
-   **Password Strength Meter**: Get instant visual feedback on the strength of your generated password, categorized as Weak, Medium, Strong, or Very Strong.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application's logic is contained within the `<script>` tag in the `index.html` file.

-   **Mode Toggling**: A checkbox input is used to toggle the visibility of the password and passphrase option containers. The UI and generator function are updated accordingly.
-   **Password Generation**: When in "Password" mode, the generator builds a string of random characters based on the user's selected criteria (length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). The final string is then shuffled to ensure randomness.
-   **Passphrase Generation**: In "Passphrase" mode, the generator randomly selects a specified number of words from a built-in `wordList` array and joins them together with a hyphen.
-   **Strength Calculation**: The password strength is calculated based on a scoring system that considers its length and the inclusion of different character types (e.g., uppercase, numbers, symbols). The score determines the color and width of the strength bar.
